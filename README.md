# MotiSlide

## Basic info:

A simple background slideshow with motivational wallpapers for Linux, written in bash.

I started this project today, because I was really mad at some of the most popular background slideshow applications. I decided to make myself one, which is simpler and better than the others.

I use wallpapers from the website: https://quotefancy.com/

The project is written in a couple of hours.

Why did I do this? Motivation is the key to success.
