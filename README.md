# MotiSlide

## Basic info:

A simple cross-platform background slideshow application with motivational wallpapers written in Go.

I got the wallpapers from https://quotefancy.com/.

Why did I do this? Motivation is the key to success. Having some motivational quote wallpapers will boost productivity.

## How to get this to work:

Just find the executable for your operating system in the `/bin` folder and run `./motislide --interval=1 --imgdir="../../images"`, in case you want to use the motivational wallpapers. 

If you have your own set of wallpaper that you want to use, just change the `--imgdir` argument to point to your personal directory.

Also, check the `--help` command to see some information about the CLI.
