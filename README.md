# MotiSlide

## Basic info:

A simple background slideshow with motivational wallpapers for Linux, written in bash.

I started this project today, because I was really mad at some of the most popular background slideshow applications. I decided to make myself one, which is simpler and better than the others.

I use wallpapers from the website: https://quotefancy.com/

The project is written in a couple of hours.

Why did I do this? Motivation is the key to success.

## How to get it to work:

It's very easy, though my machine is running Arch Linux with the Gnome DE and I'm not sure If It'll work on everyone's Linux machine. But I'm quite sure that It'll run on most distro's with the Gnome DE.

1) Make sure that all the files from this project are in the same folder

2) Run the "setSlideshowSchedule.sh" script and pass in a number parameter ranging from 1 to 60 for the transition time in minutes.

3) Enjoy!
